# The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Color Blindness by Michelle Alexander

## Introduction

lack of correlation between crime and punishment

similar official crime rates between Finland Germany and US
BUT, US incarceration rate quadrupled, Finnish rate fell by 60% and German rate remained stable

US now boasts an incarceration rate that is 6-10X greater than that of other industrialized nations â€” a development directly traceable to the drug war

1 in 3 African American men will serve in prison given current trends.

Yet mass incarceration tends to be categorized as a femininely justice issue as opposed to a racial justice or civil rights issue (or crisis)

No task is more urgent for racial justice advocates today than ensure that Americas current racial caste system is its last.

## Ch.1 The Rebirth of Caste

### Birth of Slavery

Native Americans --> "savages"
Less of a moral problem to eliminate savages than human beings

Many African Americans were initially indentured servants. Native Americans were unfit to be slaves, as they had the ability to fight back. Europeans were not common and people did not want to deter voluntary immigration. Blacks were powerless.

Bacon's Rebellion - 1675, Jamestown

Nathaniel Bacon wanted to eliminate the Native American threat and asked for the support of the militia via planter elite. When they refused, he attacked the rich.

Planters shifted their strategy for maintaining dominance by importing black slaves instead of relying on indentured servants from Europe.

Slaves directly from Africa would be less familiar with the European language and culture and thus, be far easier to control and less likely to form alliances with poor whites.

"Racial bribe": the planter class extended special privileges to poor whites in effort to drive a wedge between them and white slaves
* Greater access to Native American lands
* White servants allowed to police slaves through slave patrols and militias
* Barriers were created so that free labor not competing with slave labor 
These measures effectively eliminated the risk of future alliances between black slaves and pope whites. Poor whites had a direct, personal stake in the existence of a race-based system of slavery... and they responded to the logic of their situation, seeking ways to expand their racially privileged position.

Constitution designed for weak federal government, not only in its relationship to private property but also wrt to the rights of states to conduct their own affairs. Federalism, the division of power between the federal and state government, was the device used to protect the institution of slavery and the political power of slaveholding states.

Aggressive enforcement
Convict leasing
Arbitrary arrest
Court costs and fines need to be paid off
With no means to pay off debt, primos need sold as forced laborers

High death rates bc private contractors had no interest in health and well-being of laborers, unlike earlier slave-owners who needed their slaves

Convicts had no meaningful legal rights, literally slaves of the state

Mississippi - Parchman Farm
Organized its own convict labor camp
